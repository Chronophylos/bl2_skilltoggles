- [Discord][discord]
- PythonSDK: `v0.7.9`
- Mod Menu: `v2.4`
- EridiumLib: `v0.4.1`

---

## **üìé Features**
- deactivate the Action Skill for each character
- configurable hotkey
- options to enable the feature for each class individually


## **üìë Notes**
- this is a [PythonSDK] mod, you **can't** install it with BLCMM
- this mod needs the [EridiumLib] in order to run
- since this is often not the case with SDK mods: yes, this has multiplayer support
- deactivating Action Skills won't give you a cooldown bonus
  - there are some exceptions in Borderlands TPS where it works
- in a multiplayer environment, only the host settings of the mod are taken into account
  - that means only the host can define which Action Skills are deactivatable
  - you can still use your own hotkey
- the default toggle hotkey is `F` which also is the default Action Skill key
  - you need to *hold* the key, not just press it to avoid accidental deactivations
  - you can change it to anything in the modded keybinds but you can't change it back to `F` because it's already taken by the Action Skill
  - if you want to use the `F` key again or, generally spoken, the hotkey you have for activating the Action Skill, you need to delete the `settings.json` file in the mod directory, restart the game and reenable the mod
  - if you are using another hotkey for the Action Skill, you can also directly edit the modded hotkey in the `settings.json` file while the game is closed


## **üîß Installation**
1. download the latest **release** of this mod from [releases]
2. download the latest **release** of the EridiumLib from [here][eridiumlib_releases]
3. extract it to:
   - `Borderlands 2\Binaries\Win32\Mods`
4. activate the mod in the Mod Menu within the game
