                "- since this is often not the case with SDK mods: yes, this has multiplayer support if all players have it installed\n",
                "- deactivating Action Skills won't give you a cooldown bonus\n",
                "  - there are some exceptions in Borderlands TPS where it works\n",
                "- in a multiplayer environment, only the host settings of the mod are taken into account\n",
                "  - that means only the host can define which Action Skills are deactivatable\n",
                "  - you can still use your own hotkey\n",
                "- the default toggle key is `F` which also is the default Action Skill hotkey\n",
                "  - you need to *hold* they key, not just press it to avoid accidental deactivation\n",
                "  - you can change it to anything in the modded keybinds but you can't change it back to `F` because it's already taken by the Action Skill\n",
                "  - if you want to use the `F` key again, you need to delete the settings.json file in the mod directory, restart the game and reenable the mod\n",
                "  - if you are using another hotkey for the Action Skill, you can also directly edit the modded hotkey in the `settings.json` file while the game is closed\n",
